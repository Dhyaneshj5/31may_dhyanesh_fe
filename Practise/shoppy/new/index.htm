            <p class="sectionpera">When ACLP co-founder Meg Cadoux was treated for her first breast cancer recurrence, she wondered what she could do to reduce her risk moving forward. She asked her physicians, but received no guidance about how to participate in her own well-being.</p>
            <p class="sectionpera">When Meg finally found evidence-based information about lifestyle changes that could lower her risk, she approached Nancy Kane, an oncology nurse running a local cancer center. Meg suggested they create a course for cancer patients that would teach healthy lifestyle behaviors in the areas of diet, fitness, mindset, and personal environment. Nancy agreed that such a comprehensive approach would fill a post-treatment gap. Together, Nancy and Meg assembled a team of experts to create to the Anticancer Lifestyle Program, which launched in person in 2011 and online in 2019.</p>
            <p class="sectionpera">The Program now includes many free resources: an online course, eBooks, webinars, blogs, recipes, and more! It has served more than 60K participants from over 80 countries. Learn more about how and why they created the Program in this video.</p>
