    <h1>Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following
        elements</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;table&gt;</td>
            <td>The container element that defines the entire table. It holds all the rows (&lt;tr&gt;), headers (&lt;th&gt;), and data cells (&lt;td&gt;).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;tr&gt; (Table Row)</td>
            <td>Represents a row of cells in the table. It groups together one or more &lt;th&gt; or &lt;td&gt; elements.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;th&gt; (Table Header Cell)</td>
            <td>Defines a header cell in a table. By default, it is bold and centered. It is used to label or describe the content in a column or row.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;td&gt; (Table Data Cell)</td>
            <td>Defines a standard cell in the table that holds the actual data. It is used within a &lt;tr&gt; element to represent individual pieces of data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;thead&gt; (Table Header Group)</td>
            <td>Groups the header content in a table, typically containing one or more &lt;tr&gt; elements with &lt;th&gt; elements inside. It is useful for styling or semantic structure, especially when working with complex tables.</td>

    <h1>What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide
        examples</h1>
        <p>The difference between colspan and rowspan in HTML tables lies in how they affect the layout of table cells:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>colspan: This attribute allows a table cell to span across multiple columns. It is used when you want a cell (either a header th or a data td) to occupy the space of more than one column in a row. For example, th colspan="2" makes the header cell span across two columns horizontally.</li>
        <li>rowspan: This attribute allows a table cell to span across multiple rows. It is used when you want a cell to extend vertically across more than one row. For example, td rowspan="2" makes a data cell span two rows vertically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Table with Colspan</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Header across  Two Columns</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h1>Table with Rowspan</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Data across  Two Rows</td>
            <td>Data 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h1>Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
        alternative?</h1>
        <p>Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they are meant to represent tabular data, not to structure the design of a webpage. Using tables for layout can cause several problems, such as accessibility issues, where screen readers and assistive technologies may misinterpret the table structure as data, making navigation difficult for users with disabilities. Tables also offer limited flexibility when it comes to responsive design, making it hard to adapt to various screen sizes. Furthermore, table-based layouts often involve complex, nested HTML, making the code harder to maintain and update. A better alternative is using CSS for layout purposes. Modern CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, provide more control, flexibility, and responsiveness. These methods allow for easy creation of complex, responsive layouts that are semantically correct, easier to maintain, and accessible, without the drawbacks of using tables.</p>
