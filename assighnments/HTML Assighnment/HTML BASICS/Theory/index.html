    <h1> Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development? </h1>

    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used in web development to create the structure and content of web pages. It organizes information using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables, allowing developers to structure content logically. HTML also supports embedding multimedia like images, videos, and audio, making web pages interactive and visually engaging. Additionally, it enables navigation through hyperlinks and works seamlessly with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. In essence, HTML provides the basic framework upon which websites are built.</p>

    <h1> Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tagsand
        their purposes.</h1>
        <p>An HTML document is structured with essential tags that define its framework and functionality. Hereâ€™s the outline of a basic HTML document:</p>
        <img src="./1.png" style="height: 25% ; width: 25%;" alt="no img">
        <ul>
            <li>!DOCTYPE html: Declares the document type and ensures the browser interprets the page as HTML5.</li>
            <li>html: The root element that wraps all content in the document.</li>
            <li>head: Contains metadata like the document title, character encoding, and links to external resources (stylesheets or scripts).</li>
            <li>title: Defines the title displayed in the browser tab.</li>
            <li>body: Contains all the visible content and elements displayed on the web page, such as text, images, and links.</li>

            
        </ul>
        <p>These tags are fundamental to ensuring a well-structured and functional HTML document.</p>

        <h1>What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
            HTML? Provide examples of each</h1>
            <p>In HTML, block-level elements and inline elements serve different purposes in structuring and styling content. Block-level elements, such as div, p, h1, ul, and table, start on a new line and occupy the full width of their container by default. They are used to define larger sections or structural elements of a webpage. In contrast, inline elements, like span, a, strong, em, and img, do not start on a new line and take up only as much width as their content requires. These elements are typically used to style or define small parts of content within block-level elements, allowing for more granular formatting without breaking the text flow.</p>

            <h1>Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?
                Provide examples of semantic elements.</h1>
                <p>
                    Semantic HTML uses elements that clearly describe their meaning and role in the structure of a webpage, such as header, nav, article, section, and footer. This improves accessibility by helping screen readers and assistive technologies interpret and navigate content effectively. For SEO, semantic HTML provides search engines with better context about the content, improving visibility in search results. By using meaningful tags, developers create more readable and maintainable code while enhancing the user experience for all visitors. Examples of semantic elements include main for primary content and aside for supplementary information.</p>
