    <h1>What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea, select, and button elements. in short in peragraph </h1>
    <p>HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. They facilitate interactions like submitting data, logging in, or performing searches. The input element captures single-line data like text, emails, or passwords. The textarea is designed for multi-line text input, such as comments or messages. The select element creates dropdown menus for choosing from predefined options. The button element triggers actions, such as form submission or custom scripts. Together, these elements enable user interaction and data collection on websites.    </p>

        <h1>Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. 
            When should each be used?</h1>
            <p>The GET method appends form data to the URL as query parameters, making it visible and limited in length. It is suitable for retrieving or searching data where the request does not modify server-side content (e.g., search forms). The POST method sends form data in the HTTP request body, keeping it hidden and allowing larger amounts of data. It is ideal for actions that modify data on the server, such as submitting registration forms or uploading files. Use GET for safe, idempotent requests and POST for secure and data-sensitive operations.            </p>

            <h1>What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve 
                accessibility?</h1>
                <p>
                    The label element in a form is used to define a label for an input element, improving its accessibility. It associates text with a specific form control, making it clear to users what information is required. When a user clicks on the label, the corresponding input field is focused, enhancing ease of use. This is particularly helpful for screen readers, which can read the label text and provide context for visually impaired users, ensuring a more accessible and user-friendly experience.</p>
